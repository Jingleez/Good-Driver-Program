# Good Driver Incentive Program

## Project Overview

This project was developed as a group project for **CPSC 4910**.

The **Good (Truck) Driver Incentive Program** is a web application designed to improve on-road performance among truck drivers by implementing an incentive-based reward system. Sponsors (companies) can reward drivers with points for good driving behavior, which can then be redeemed for products from a sponsor-specific catalog. The application provides comprehensive functionality for drivers, sponsors, and admin users, leveraging modern web technologies and third-party APIs for a robust and scalable solution.
